# Russian Roulette Game in 34 Programming Languages

## Introduction
This repository contains a fun, experimental collection of *Russian Roulette* games written in 34 different programming languages. The purpose of this project is to explore the syntax and style of different languages through the silly concept of a Russian Roulette game.

Please note that **these programs were written by GPT for fun**. I only have experience programming in five of the languages (C++, C#, GML, Python, and JavaScript), so I used this project to better understand the differences in syntax and paradigms of other languages.
